Command-line utility for encoding and decoding arbitrary binary data
to and from easily typed words.

You might expect data encoded in base 256 to be more space efficient
than data encoded in base 16, but with this particular set of symbols,
that is not the case! Likewise, you have to type more, not less, than
you would if you use my base 256 instead of base 16. So why?

The purpose of `lastresort` is to make manual input of binary data
onto a computer less error-prone compared to typing in the base 16 or
[base 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding of said data.
Whereas manually typing out base 64 is painful, and base 16 makes it
easy to lose track of where you are while typing, `lastresort` attempts
to remedy both of these problems by using human words.

Sample use-cases include typing in your SSH private key on a computer
that is running a live USB stick copy of its OS without persistent
storage, and which doesn't have a useable webcamera leaving you
unable to enter the data using a QR-code.

## Codecs

`lastresort` supports the following codecs:

- EFF Short Wordlist 2.0, the legacy codec

### EFF Short Wordlist 2.0

The EFF Short Wordlist 2.0 is a list of 1,296 memorable and distinct words
with a few additional features making the words easy to type:

> * Each word has a unique three-character prefix. This means that future
>   software could auto-complete words in the passphrase after the user
>   has typed the first three characters
> * All words are at least an edit distance of 3 apart. This means that
>   future software could correct any single typo [...] (and in many cases
>   more than one typo).

https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases

This wordlist is also used in the `pgen` passphrase generator.
See https://github.com/ctsrc/pgen for more about `pgen`.

In `lastresort`, 256 of the words from this list are used when using this codec.

## Example input and outputs using the different codecs

In the `sample_data` directory of this repository, we have
a file named `id_ed25519` containing the following
OpenSSH ed25519 private key:

```text
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW

p0r3nHUmj+QkHx6zg7YdAAAAEGVyaWtuQGxpYmVyYXRpb24BAgMEBQ==
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

The corresponding base 256 encoded outputs using each of the different
codecs available in `lastresort` are shown is the subsections below.

### Example output using the EFF Short Wordlist 2.0 codec

If we run `lastresort` with the above private key `id_ed25519`
as input, and we use the EFF Short Wordlist 2.0 codec:

```zsh
cargo run -- < sample_data/inputs/id_ed25519
```

We get the following base 256 encoded output:
