You might expect data encoded in base 256 to be more space efficient
than data encoded in base 16, but with this particular set of symbols,
that is not the case! Likewise, you have to type more, not less, than
you would if you use my base 256 instead of base 16. So why?

The purpose of `lastresort` is to make manual input of binary data
onto a computer less error-prone compared to typing in the base 16 or
[base 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding of said data.

Manually typing out base 64 is painful, and base 16 makes it
easy to lose track of where you are while typing. `lastresort` attempts
to remedy both of these problems by using human words.

Here is a quick example:

Imagine a file with three bytes in it. In hexadecimal this file
might look like:

```text
00000000: 0505 05                                  ...
```

In other words, this file contains three bytes `0x05 0x05 0x05`.

That's not so bad, and it's quick and easy to type even in hex.

But when the amount of data gets bigger, it gets more and more tricky
to manually type in the bytes by hand. When might you want to do so?

Sample use-cases include typing in your SSH private key on a computer
that is running a live USB stick copy of its OS without persistent
storage, and which doesn't have a useable webcamera leaving you
unable to enter the data using a QR-code.

Anyways, to continue with the example from above of the three bytes.

In base64 this is:

```text
BQUF
```

In `lastresort` base 256 using the default codec PGP Word List, it is:

```text
adult amulet adult
```

By now, you should see both:

- Why the name of this command is `lastresort`, and
- How in the case of greater amount of bytes, `lastresort` can be
  of great help :)

## Codecs

`lastresort` supports the following codecs:

- PGP Word List, the default codec
- EFF Short Wordlist 2.0, the legacy codec

### PGP Word List

> The PGP Word List ("Pretty Good Privacy word list", also called
> a biometric word list [...]) is a list of words for conveying data bytes
> in a clear unambiguous way via a voice channel. They are analogous
> in purpose to the NATO phonetic alphabet used by pilots,
> except a longer list of words is used, each word corresponding
> to one of the 256 distinct numeric byte values.
>
> [...]
>
> The list is actually composed of two lists, each containing
> 256 phonetically distinct words, in which each word represents
> a different byte value between 0 and 255. Two lists are used
> because reading aloud long random sequences of human words
> usually risks three kinds of errors:
> 1) transposition of two consecutive words,
> 2) duplicate words, or
> 3) omitted words.
>
> To detect all three kinds of errors, the two lists are used alternately
> for the even-offset bytes and the odd-offset bytes in the byte sequence.
> Each byte value is actually represented by two different words,
> depending on whether that byte appears at an even or an odd offset
> from the beginning of the byte sequence. The two lists are
> readily distinguished by the number of syllables;
> the even list has words of two syllables, the odd list has three.
> The two lists have a maximum word length of 9 and 11 letters, respectively.

### EFF Short Wordlist 2.0

The EFF Short Wordlist 2.0 is a list of 1,296 memorable and distinct words
with a few additional features making the words easy to type:

> * Each word has a unique three-character prefix. This means that future
>   software could auto-complete words in the passphrase after the user
>   has typed the first three characters
> * All words are at least an edit distance of 3 apart. This means that
>   future software could correct any single typo [...] (and in many cases
>   more than one typo).

https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases

This wordlist is also used in the `pgen` passphrase generator.
See https://github.com/ctsrc/pgen for more about `pgen`.

In `lastresort`, 256 of the words from this list are used when using this codec.

## Example input and outputs using the different codecs

In the `sample_data` directory of this repository, we have
a file named `id_ed25519` containing the following
OpenSSH ed25519 private key:

```text
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW

The corresponding base 256 encoded outputs using each of the different
codecs available in `lastresort` are shown is the subsections below.

### Example output using the PGP Word List codec

If we run `lastresort` with the above private key `id_ed25519`
as input, and we use the PGP Word List codec:

```zsh
cargo run -- -i sample_data/inputs/id_ed25519
```

We get the following base 256 encoded output:
